// tests/guardrails.test.ts: proves the .arkitect custom checks themselves work, not just that the
// repo currently passes them. Two real failures motivate this file:
//   · reka-trigger-tooltip-button.mjs (2026-07-16) encoded a wrong diagnosis AND crashed on import
//     (`Cannot find package 'connections-arkitect'`), so it never ran at all. A check that throws
//     and a check that passes look the same from a distance. See .arkitect/reports/2026-07-16T07-13-00-383Z/
//     FIX_QUEUE.md is the evidence trail.
//   · spawn-console-window.mjs's first cut had a blind spot shaped exactly like the bug it exists to
//     catch: it only saw literal argv, so a resolveClaudeExe() spawn slipped through unnoticed.
// "The check passes" is not evidence the check works; it might not even be running. So for every
// check under .arkitect/your-checks/code, discovered by reading the directory (never hardcoded, so
// a new check cannot silently dodge this file), we: import it for real, assert it exports a
// well-formed gating audit, run it against the live repo root, and, for every check that exposes
// findViolations, prove it actually fires on the broken shape it claims to catch and stays quiet on
// the fixed one. A guardrail that cannot fail is not a guardrail.
