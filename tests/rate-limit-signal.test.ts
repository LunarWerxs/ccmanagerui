// tests/rate-limit-signal.test.ts — telling a 529 apart from a spent quota.
//
// The bug this locks out, verbatim from a real run (2026-07-16): a run whose only two events were
// "session started" and "API Error: 529 Overloaded. This is a server-side issue, usually temporary
// — try again in a moment." was finalized status='rate_limited' — parked as though the user's
// 5-hour window were spent. It wasn't; the same message sent from the desktop app went straight
// through, because a 529 clears in seconds. One pattern list covered both, so they were the same
// event as far as the daemon could tell.
//
// Both directions are load-bearing, and they are NOT symmetric:
//   · a quota wall read as transient = a few wasted retries against a wall, then it parks anyway;
//   · a transient read as quota      = today's bug (a run parked for hours over a blip).
// Hence classifyLimit's rule: ambiguous text lands on QUOTA (the already-shipped behavior), and
// only an unmistakable server-side signature is promoted to transient. These tests pin that
// asymmetry, because a careless future edit to the pattern lists would silently undo it.
