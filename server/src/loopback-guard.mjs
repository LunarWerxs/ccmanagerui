/**
 * Shared cross-site (CSRF) guard for the LunarWerx loopback daemons — the single audited copy
 * that ccmanagerui / RepoYeti / ReDesign / DevWebUI all vendor. Synced from the shared kit, do
 * not edit in an app (change it here + re-sync).
 *
 * THE THREAT (classic local-daemon CSRF — the Jupyter/Selenium/dev-server CVE class): each app is
 * a Bun+Hono daemon binding `127.0.0.1:<port>` with a REST API that, on the local path, is
 * UNAUTHENTICATED by design (a single-user tool on the owner's machine). But "loopback + no auth"
 * is NOT private: a browser lets ANY web page the owner visits POST to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
 * Without a guard, a malicious page could drive a mutating route — run a queued `claude`, set a git
 * remote + push, open a file — with the owner's own credentials, no approval: a drive-by RCE. A
 * cross-site GET could also exfiltrate local data.
 *
 * THE DEFENSE (no tokens, no client changes, robust to the "simple request" CORS bypass): the
 * browser itself stamps the request's provenance in headers page JS CANNOT forge —
 *   · `Sec-Fetch-Site` — set by the browser on every fetch/navigation. Another site gets
 *     `cross-site`; the app's own SPA gets `same-origin`; the dev SPA (Vite :5173 → daemon) gets
 *     `same-site`. It is a Forbidden header — page script cannot override it. Reject `cross-site`.
 *   · `Origin` — present on all cross-origin requests, INCLUDING a "simple" text/plain POST that
 *     skips CORS preflight (the exact bypass a CORS-only fix misses). Present + non-loopback host →
 *     reject. This also stops DNS-rebinding (evil.com's A-record → 127.0.0.1: the page's Origin is
 *     still evil.com).
 *   · `Host` — a PRESENT non-loopback Host is rejected (a second rebinding backstop, and the one
 *     signal left when a same-origin GET omits Origin). An ABSENT Host is allowed: a real browser
 *     ALWAYS sends Host, so no-Host-at-all is a non-browser client (curl/tray/MCP/an HTTP tool) —
 *     not a browser-CSRF vector — consistent with an absent Origin being allowed.
 * A request with none of these browser markers (curl, the tray probe, an MCP client) is allowed —
 * those are same-machine tools the owner ran deliberately; a local shell attacker already owns the
 * session. The threat is specifically the *browser* drive-by.
 *
 * WIRING IS APP-LOCAL (this module is guard LOGIC only): a loopback-only daemon wires it as
 * `app.use('/api/*', loopbackGuard)`; a daemon that is ALSO exposed over a tunnel (RepoYeti) runs
 * it ONLY on the local path — `app.use('/api/*', (c, next) => isRemoteRequest(c) ? next() :
 * loopbackGuard(c, next))` — because a genuine tunnel request legitimately carries a non-loopback
 * Host/Origin and is CSRF-gated by its own SameSite session cookie + auth instead. Never apply it
 * to `/oauth/*` (those are legit cross-site OAuth returns). Narrowing `cors()` to loopback origins
 * (via `isLoopbackOrigin`) is a worthwhile defense-in-depth for reads, but the guard — not CORS —
 * is what stops the write: CORS governs response READABILITY, and the CSRF damage is done the
 * moment the request is PROCESSED.
