// server/src/rate-limit-signal.ts — telling a QUOTA wall apart from a TRANSIENT overload.
//
// These used to be ONE pattern list in dispatch.ts, and that conflation was a real bug: a run that
// died on "API Error: 529 Overloaded. This is a server-side issue, usually temporary — try again in
// a moment." was finalized status='rate_limited', i.e. parked as though the user's 5-hour window
// were spent. It isn't. They are opposite failures wearing the same word:
//
//   · QUOTA    — "You've hit your session limit · resets 9:10am", 429/too many requests, usage
//                limit. YOUR allowance is spent. Only TIME fixes it; the right move is to wait for
//                the reset and resume (monitor.ts).
//   · TRANSIENT — 529, "Overloaded", "temporarily unavailable". ANTHROPIC'S servers are saturated.
//                It clears in seconds; the right move is to back off and retry (dispatch.ts).
//
// Retrying a quota wall hammers a door that won't open for hours. Parking an overload for 5 hours
// wastes the run for no reason — which is exactly what happened, and why the same message sent from
// the desktop app (which just retries) went through fine.
//
// A LEAF module: zero imports, so dispatch.ts, rate-limit-discovery.ts and db.ts's repair migration
// can all share one truth without an import cycle.

/**
 * YOUR allowance is spent — only time fixes it.

 * The ambiguous/generic entries (`rate limit`, bare `429`) live HERE on purpose. Quota is the
 * conservative bucket: it is what the single list already did for every one of these strings, so
 * anything that doesn't unambiguously name a server-side overload keeps its existing, shipped
 * behavior. Mis-sorting a real overload into quota reproduces today's bug; mis-sorting a real quota
 * wall into transient burns a couple of harmless retries against a wall and then still parks. The
 * asymmetry says: only promote to TRANSIENT on an unmistakable signature.

/**
 * WHERE a pattern above is allowed to match — the other half of the detector, and the more
 * important one.
 *
 * The patterns are deliberately loose (`\b529\b`, `\bquota\b`), which is fine for text the CLI
 * emits about its own state and catastrophic for anything else. Matching them against every event
 * marked EVERY run that merely TALKED about rate limits as rate-limited: an agent grepping for
 * "session limit", a Read whose output happened to contain line number 529, an Edit touching this
 * very file. Both `rate_limited` rows in the shipped DB were exactly that — false positives on runs
 * that exited 0 with the job done (2026-07-15), which then fed the auto-resume monitor a queue of
 * phantom stops to babysit.
 *
 * So: model prose, tool inputs, and tool results are NEVER evidence — only the CLI's own report is.
 * A genuine limit surfaces as a SYNTHETIC assistant message (`message.model === '<synthetic>'` with
 * `isApiErrorMessage: true`, e.g. "You've hit your session limit · resets 5:40am"), as an errored
 * terminal `result`, or on stderr. Note `<synthetic>` alone is not enough: the CLI also emits
 * `<synthetic>` no-op chatter with `isApiErrorMessage: false` ("No response requested.").
 *
 * This gate binds BOTH kinds. A transient detector that skipped it would reintroduce the identical
 * false-positive class on the retry path — and a false transient re-RUNS the prompt, which is worse
 * than a false park.
