// server/src/usage-budget.ts — assemble the answer to "how much can I actually spend?".
//
// This is the join between the two halves:
//   usage-history.ts  gives  percent/hour   (how fast the cap is being eaten)
//   usage-tokens.ts   gives  tokens/hour    (what we actually spent, counted)
//
// Dividing one by the other yields TOKENS PER PERCENT: the size of 1% of the weekly quota, measured
// rather than looked up. Anthropic does not publish the quota (limit_dollars is null, no token
// counts), so measuring it from our own spend is the only way to get a denominator at all.
//
// The confidence rating is not decoration. The derivation assumes the tokens we can SEE are the
// tokens that moved the percentage. That assumption breaks whenever the account is also used
// somewhere we cannot observe (the Claude Desktop app, the web UI, another machine) — and when it
// breaks it always fails the SAME way: we attribute all of the % movement to a fraction of the real
// spend, so tokensPerPercent comes out too big and remainingTokens reads optimistically high. An
// agent that trusts an inflated budget overruns its quota mid-task, which is exactly the failure this
// whole subsystem exists to prevent. So the caveat travels with the number, always.
