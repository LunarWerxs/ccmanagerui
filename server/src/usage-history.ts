// server/src/usage-history.ts — turn a percentage into a RATE, and a rate into a deadline.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. "You are at 98%" is almost useless to an agent deciding whether to start
// a piece of work. 98% with a reset in 20 minutes is fine. 98% with a reset in four days, while
// burning 1%/hour, means you die mid-task in about two hours. Same number, opposite decision. The
// percentage alone cannot tell them apart; only its DERIVATIVE can.
//
// The endpoint gives us no rate (and no token or dollar counts — limit_dollars/used_dollars are null
// on a subscription), so we derive one: the background sweep already re-reads usage every 15 minutes,
// so we keep those readings and differentiate them.
//
// WHAT COMES OUT: burn rate in %/hour, hours of headroom left at that rate, the projected instant of
// exhaustion, and the single question that actually decides things:
//   "will I run out BEFORE the window resets?"
// If no, the cap is irrelevant and you can work freely. If yes, you know exactly how long you have.
//
// The pure math is separated from the storage so it is unit-testable without touching the disk.

 *
 *  1. **A reset inside the window.** When the weekly window rolls over, the % drops to ~0. Naively
 *     differencing across that gives a large NEGATIVE rate, which would then be read as "you are
 *     gaining quota" and produce an infinite headroom. So we only measure from the LAST reset
 *     onward: walk back and cut the moment we see the percentage fall.
 *  2. **A flat window.** If you haven't worked, the rate is a legitimate 0, which must be reported as
 *     zero (meaning "no exhaustion in sight"), not as unknown.
 *
 * Returns null only when there genuinely isn't enough signal: fewer than 2 samples, or a span shorter
 * than MIN_SPAN_MIN.
