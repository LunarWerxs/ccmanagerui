// ignores both `--window-size` and the saved placement, so the page corrects itself
// (web/src/lib/window-size-hint.ts). Its one caller is the portable-window route
// (server/src/index.ts).
//
// The param name and the "WxH" shape are a contract shared with the web applier and the
// tray (misc/Tray-Host.ps1) — keep the three in step. Deliberately its own module with no
// daemon imports, so tests can exercise it against a scratch profile without dragging in the
// runtime/instance config machinery.
