/**
 * Shared running-instance pointer for the LunarWerx daemons. The daemon may bind a
 * different port than requested (the preferred one was busy), so it records the port
 * it ACTUALLY bound in `<configDir>/runtime.json`. Launchers read this to open the
 * browser at the right URL and to detect an already-running instance via /api/health;
 * a dev Vite proxy can follow it too. Best-effort throughout: a write/read failure
 * never blocks the daemon.
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic (Bun + Node). Synced from the shared kit, do not edit in an
 * app; the `.d.mts` sibling types the import for the TypeScript apps.
 *
 * Per-app knobs:
 *   configDir    resolved dir that holds runtime.json (each app keeps its own
 *                resolution, e.g. honouring a $APP_HOME override, as local code)
 *   serviceName  if set, findLiveInstance also requires the health body's `service`
 *                to equal it (rejects a foreign daemon that happened to grab the port)
 *   host         host used in the recorded url (default "127.0.0.1")

   *
   * `attempts` > 1 re-probes before concluding "nothing running". A single probe is a
   * COIN FLIP for the single-instance guard: a daemon that is alive but momentarily busy
   * (boot-time scanning, a slow sync tick) misses one probe, the guard concludes the port
   * is free, and the caller starts a SECOND daemon that then hops to PORT+1 — leaving two
   * live daemons and a runtime pointer aimed at the wrong one. Observed repeatedly in
   * ccmanagerui's daemon.log (paired starts seconds apart, the second logging "port N was
   * busy"). Callers deciding whether to SPAWN should pass attempts >= 2; callers merely
   * reporting status can keep the cheap single probe.
   *
   * A service-name mismatch is a DEFINITIVE answer (someone else's server owns that port),
   * so it returns immediately and is never retried — only transient failures (timeout,
   * connection refused, a non-ok response) are worth a second look.
