// Guardrail for a real bug that hid for months (found 2026-07-16): server/src/dispatch.ts's
// isRunnerAlive() asked Windows "is any process running this run's spec file?" with
//
//     Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "CommandLine LIKE '%<id>.spec.json%'"
//
// spawned as `powershell -Command "<that query>"`. The needle is IN the powershell's own command
// line — it IS the LIKE pattern — so the query always matched ITSELF and the count was never zero.
// The probe therefore answered "runner alive" for every reattach on Windows, which silently
// disabled three things that look perfectly correct in the source:
//   · reattachRuns's "trust the stored childPid ONLY while the runner is verifiably alive" guard,
//     whose own comment names the stakes: "stuck run, or a cancel force-killing an innocent
//     process". A recycled pid answers isAlive() forever → the run sits 'running' for good, and
//     Cancel would killTree() whatever now owns that number;
//   · its "runner gone and left nothing to replay → mark failed" branch — unreachable;
//   · tailRun's dead-runner path — unreachable for the same reason.
// Nothing failed loudly. The probe just always said yes.
//
// THE RULE: a `CommandLine LIKE` process query executed through a spawned shell MUST exclude the
// querying process (`AND ProcessId <> $PID`). This is not defensive tidiness — without it the
// result is unconditionally non-empty, so the query cannot answer the question it was written to
// ask.
//
// Deliberately narrow, because the failure is specific to the needle living inside the filter
// string:
//   · `-Filter "Name='Claude.exe'"` (core/process.ts) is FINE — a name match can't hit the
//     powershell doing the asking, and there is no needle to echo.
//   · misc/Restart-Daemon.ps1 is FINE — it filters by Name, applies the tray-adapter needle in
//     PowerShell code against $p.CommandLine, and additionally skips $PID by hand. That is the
//     safe shape, and it is exactly why that script never broke while isRunnerAlive did.
//   · POSIX `ps -eo args=` is FINE — ps's own args don't contain the needle.
//
// Self-contained by design: imports nothing from the arkitect core (a bare
// `import "connections-arkitect"` doesn't resolve from a check that lives in the repo rather than
// the runner's node_modules), and returns plain finding objects — which the runner accepts as-is.
