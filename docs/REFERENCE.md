this file is for running, configuring and hacking on it.

## MCP server

The daemon's REST API is also exposed over MCP stdio (`server/src/mcp.ts`, or `bun run mcp`), so
agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor) can drive sessions, the run queue, accounts, the
scheduler, and instances the same way the web UI does. Start the daemon first; the MCP server
follows its actual bound port via the runtime pointer, overridable with `CCMANAGERUI_URL` (full base
URL) or `CCMANAGERUI_PORT`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ccmanagerui": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "--cwd", "<path-to-ccmanagerui>", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools cover sessions (list / get / tail across Claude, Codex, and OpenCode), the queue (list / add /
update / run / cancel / events), accounts (secrets always masked), the scheduler (get / set),
Claude Desktop instances (list / launch / quit), Claude CLI instances and Codex CLI instances
(list / create / launch / login helper), usage-check (`check_usage`, `check_my_usage`), and the
auto-resume monitor (get / set), plus an update check. Mutating tools say `MUTATES:` in their
description; there is deliberately no shutdown tool.

`list_sessions`, `get_session`, and `tail_session` accept a `source` of `claude`, `codex`, or
`opencode`; every returned session is source-tagged. Session viewing/search is unified, but queue
dispatch, composing replies, and rate-limit auto-resume remain Claude-only.

### Usage-check

`check_usage { account?, configDir? }` and `check_my_usage {}` let any MCP-speaking agent read an
account's remaining Claude subscription quota without asking a human. Pass `account` (a saved
dispatch account id or label) or `configDir` (a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` that's been `/login`'d once);
`check_my_usage` is a shorthand self-check of the calling process's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Both
report the session (5h) %, the weekly (all-models) %, and any per-model weekly %.

**The weekly (all-models) % is the binding cap.** A fresh session % is a red herring when weekly is
near 100, and switching the flagship model doesn't dodge the shared weekly bucket. An agent should
check its own quota before a heavy multi-agent fan-out and pace accordingly, routing heavy work to
whichever account has the lowest weekly %.

## Claude Desktop session mapping

Claude Desktop and the `claude` CLI write the same transcript store under
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`. Desktop separately keeps per-chat metadata
under `<user-data-dir>/claude-code-sessions/<org>/<user>/local_*.json`; the metadata's
`cliSessionId` is the only reliable link to the shared transcript. The scanner in
`server/src/instance-sessions.ts` therefore:

- matches only by `cliSessionId`, never metadata filenames or titles;
- scans both `%APPDATA%/Claude/` and every `~/.claude-instances/<name>/` store; and
- treats Desktop activity timestamps as advisory because externally appended turns do not
  reliably update them.

Never use `claude://resume?session=<uuid>` to refresh a live chat. It is a one-way import for a
finished CLI session: it rewrites the shared transcript without thinking blocks and creates a
second Desktop chat. External dispatch can append valid turns to a Desktop-backed transcript, but
whether reopening an existing Desktop chat causes the renderer to request those turns is not a
stable interface and must not be assumed by product logic.

## Config (env)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `7787` | preferred API/UI port (hops if busy) |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | loopback bind host; only `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, and `::1` are accepted because the local API is intentionally passwordless |
| `CCMANAGERUI_PORT_FIXED` | unset | `1` = bind `PORT` exactly, skip the single-instance/port-hop |
| `CCMANAGERUI_HOME` | `~/.ccmanagerui` | config dir (`runtime.json`, instance-identity cache) |
| `CCMANAGERUI_SHUTDOWN_TOKEN` | unset | if set, `/api/shutdown` requires a matching `x-ccmanagerui-shutdown-token` header (the tray sets it) |
| `CCMANAGERUI_FAKE` | unset | dispatch uses the harmless fake CLI |
| `CCMANAGERUI_DB` | `server/data/ccmanagerui.db` | sqlite path |
| `CCMANAGERUI_RUN_LOG_DIR` | `server/data/run-logs` | detached-run log and sidecar directory |
| `CCMANAGERUI_CODEX_HOME` | `~/.codex` | default Codex rollout store to scan |
| `CCMANAGERUI_CODEX_PATH` | auto-detected / `codex` | Codex executable used by managed Codex instances |
| `CCMANAGERUI_OPENCODE_DB` | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | OpenCode CLI/Desktop SQLite session store |

`/api/health` returns `service: "ccmanagerui"`, which is load-bearing for the single-instance
pointer.

Manually added dispatch API keys and OAuth tokens are stored as plain values in the per-user SQLite
database so the database remains portable. The state directories and database receive owner-only
POSIX modes where supported, and the daemon cannot bind beyond loopback. This protects the local
service boundary but is not a password vault: anyone who can read files as the same OS user can
read those manually supplied credentials.

## Auto-update

Opt-in background self-update (off by default; it restarts the daemon):

```
POST /api/update/settings   { "enabled": true, "intervalSecs": 21600 }
```

`intervalSecs` clamps to [900, 604800]; default 21600 (6h). Each tick checks the remote and, only if
the working tree is clean, applies (`git pull --ff-only` + reinstall + rebuild) and relaunches itself
on the same port (`CCMANAGERUI_RELAUNCH=1` makes the successor wait for the predecessor to free it).
A dirty tree is never touched.

Because updates are a `git pull --ff-only` against `origin/main`, **pushing `main` is the release**:
as soon as `main` moves, every instance with auto-update enabled fast-forwards to it on its next
check. Treat a push to `main` as user-facing rather than as a staging step.

## Instance appearance

Renaming an instance changes only its display label; it never renames the profile folder. Windows
can hold a running profile folder open, and the folder name is also the stable session/instance id.
The removed `POST /api/instances/:dir/rename` endpoint must not be restored as a live folder rename.

Appearance metadata `{ label, icon, color }` lives in
`~/.ccmanagerui/instance-meta.json`, keyed by normalized folder path and cleaned up when the
instance is deleted. `POST /api/instances/:dir/meta` applies a present value, clears a field when it
is `null`, and leaves an absent field unchanged. The curated icon/color keys live in
`server/src/core/shared.ts`; the web mapping and deterministic defaults live in
`web/src/lib/instance-appearance.ts`.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vue 3 + Vite, a shared LunarWerx UI kit (shadcn-vue `reka-mira` on Reka UI), Tailwind v4, `@lucide/vue`, TypeScript |
| Backend | **Bun + Hono**, `bun:sqlite` (queue / dispatch / scheduler / accounts and read-only OpenCode access) + JSON under `CONFIG_DIR`, SSE (`hono/streaming`) for live run output |
| Dispatch | `Bun.spawn` of the real `claude` CLI (no Agent SDK) |
| Multi-instance | per-OS instance discovery / launch / quit / create (`server/src/core/*`): Windows DPAPI / macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret for reading each isolated instance's stored credentials |
| Launcher | Windows browser + system-tray (`misc/`) |

## Layout

```
server/    Bun + Hono daemon: sqlite, Claude/Codex/OpenCode session readers, transcript tail,
           dispatch, scheduler, instance pointer, core/ (Claude Desktop/CLI + Codex CLI instances)
web/       Vue 3 SPA (Sessions / Queue / Instances views)
tests/     launcher.test.ts (the tray guard, Windows-gated) + server/instance unit tests
misc/      the Windows launcher toolkit (tray .ps1 / .vbs / .ico / Create-Shortcut / Make-Icon / Rebuild.bat)
scripts/   repo tooling (screenshots/: regenerate the README images)
```

## Screenshots

The three README images are generated, not hand-taken:

```
bun run screenshots                 # shoot and install into .github/screenshots/
bun run screenshots -- --keep       # write to tmp/screenshots/ instead, to eyeball first
bun run screenshots -- --url <url>  # reuse a server you already have running
```

It starts its own web server on a private port (5199, so an open dev session on 5173 is neither
disturbed nor photographed), drives headless Chrome over the DevTools protocol, and writes one PNG
per view at a viewport sized to that view's max-width shell.

**Nothing real is ever in frame.** These images are public, so instead of pointing a daemon at a
synthetic home directory, `scripts/screenshots/page-fixtures.js` replaces `window.fetch` before the
SPA boots: every `/api/` response is invented and no daemon runs at all. Any request that finds no
fixture is recorded, and the run **fails** rather than keeping images that could contain live data.
Adding a shot means adding an entry to `SHOTS` in `capture.mjs`; each one carries an `expect`
predicate that must hold before the shutter fires, so a fixture that stops matching the UI fails
the run instead of silently producing a screenshot of empty skeletons.

Requires a Chromium-based browser; set `CHROME_PATH` if it is not in a standard location.

## Checks

`bun run check` runs Biome + the i18n gate + a kit drift-check. The kit check needs an internal
LunarWerx kit checkout, so it's **owner-only and skipped in CI**; external contributors should run
the individual checks instead:

- `bun run lint`: Biome.
- `bun run --cwd web check:i18n`: no hardcoded UI strings; every `t()` key resolves (also gates `build`).
- `bun test`: includes the Windows-gated tray launcher guard and instance/crypto tests.
- `bun run typecheck`: web (`vue-tsc`) + server (`tsc`).

CI runs these across `[ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]`, so a green local run on one OS clears one
leg of two.
